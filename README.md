## Key Terms for Aerospike Schema Data Models

### Namespace
This is where all policies, sets, and record data reside, along with the last update time. You can create multiple namespaces based on your requirements.

### Key
The unique identifier for each record.

### Metadata
Includes the generation counter and time to live (TTL) for records.

### Bin
This is where the actual data is stored. A bin can accept any type of data.

### Sets
A collection of records. If you donâ€™t define a set for a record, it will belong to the null set within the namespace.
