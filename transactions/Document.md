UTXO Management System with Concurrent Access Using Go Channels
Overview
In this document, we will outline the design and implementation of a system that manages Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) with the goal of ensuring thread-safe concurrent access. The core focus of this system is to handle cases where multiple threads (or goroutines in Go) may attempt to access and modify the same set of UTXOs associated with a particular XPUB key (Extended Public Key), ensuring that transaction processing is done serially for the same XPUB key.

Problem Statement
We need to create a system where multiple threads or goroutines can attempt to retrieve and update UTXOs related to the same XPUB key. However, only one thread should be allowed to process UTXOs for any specific XPUB key at a time, even if multiple threads are trying to access the same UTXOs concurrently.
